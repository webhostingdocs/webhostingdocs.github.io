              <h2>Here's how I can help:</h2>
              <h4>For every customer that can find the answers to their questions using self-service, there is one less call or ticket to your support department.</h4>
              <p>I write the technical documentation that your customers are looking for in order to get started with their new service or to update or configure their existing service: getting started guides, install guides, user guides, release notes, READMEs, and more.</p> 
              <p>I can create anything from a simple and user-friendly setup guide for a basic product or service all the way up to highly technical developer-centric documentation for APIs and other web services. I can also create README files and man pages for applications created in-house for either customer or internal use. A small portfolio of work examples is <a href="#services">located below</a>. Please note that these are examples only - any documentation I create for you will match your current document format and layouts. </p>
              <p>Many small web hosting companies do not have or need a full-time technical writer on staff, meaning that someone has to be pulled away from their normal duties to create documentation, or worse yet, no documentation is created at all. This wastes your employees time and leaves your customers frustrated, which results in needless calls and tickets to tech support. As a freelancer, I can be brought on board only when needed, saving your employees time, saving you money, and increasing customer satisfaction.</p>
              <p>I also offer services such as Content Inventories (an overview of your documentation, when it was last updated, broken links, etc.), User Advocacy (understanding how your users interact with your website) and Personas (user research to help you target your products and services better). All of these services help you to better understand and serve your customers.</p>
              <p>I offer pricing by the document or by the project, and will work with you to determine your documentation needs and find the best solution. <a href="#contact">Contact me</a> for more information.</p>
