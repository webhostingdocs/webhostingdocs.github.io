              <h2>Here's how I can help:</h2>
              <h4>For every customer that can find the answers to their questions using self-service, there is one less call or ticket to your support department.</h4>
              <p>I write the technical documentation that your customers are looking for in order to get started with their new service or to update or configure their existing service: getting started guides, install guides, user guides, release notes, READMEs, and more. I have close to 20 years experience in IT, including nearly 10 years experience working in web hosting: 3 years working in technical support/system admin and 6+ years as a technical writer. I understand the web hosting business, and more importantly I understand the needs of web hosting customers. My technical background means that I'm also able to work directly with your support and system admin teams because I've done the same type of work myself.</p>
              <p>Because many small web hosting companies do not have or need a full-time technical writer on staff, someone has to be pulled away from their normal duties to create documentation, which wastes your employees time. Or worse yet, no documentation is created at all, leaving your customers frustrated, resulting in needless calls and tickets to tech support. As a freelancer, I can be brought on board only when needed, saving your employees time, saving you money, and increasing customer satisfaction.</p>
              <p>I also offer services such as <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/content-inventory.html">Content Inventories</a> (an overview of your documentation, when it was last updated, broken links, etc.), <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html">User Personas</a> (a fictional character that represents a group of users), software testing (usually hand in hand with new or updated product documentation), and can make recommendations about knowledge base organization and software. </p>
              <p>I offer pricing by the document or by the project, and will work with you to determine your documentation needs and find the best solution. <a href="#contact">Contact me</a> for more information.</p>
