title: User Advocacy

A user advocate acts as the voice of the user inside the company. The user advocate looks at your website, products and services, and the overall user experience from the perspective of your customer. The user advocate can help you understand how your customer actually sees your company, which might be very different from how you think they see your company.   

As someone on the outside looking in, I can work very effectively as a user advocate for your company, providing insight and information on things like ease of use, navigation, and the overall user experience that will allow you to better meet the needs of new and existing customers.
