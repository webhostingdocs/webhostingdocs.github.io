Many web hosting companies are now offering their customers the ability to manage their servers, accounts, and systems via RESTful APIs. This allows the customer to scale their resources up or down programmatically based on real-time usage. 

This API documentation example shows a way to document a JSON RESTful API. This documentation assumes a fairly advanced level of system administration skill on the part of the user. This is an example of the type of developer-centric documentation I can provide.
