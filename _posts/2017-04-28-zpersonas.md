A persona is a fictional character created to represent different types of users, and to give insight into their goals, behaviors, and abilities. 

Using your existing customer tracking systems and website log files, I can help create a set of personas to help you better focus on who your customers actually are so that you can provide the products, services, and documentation theyâ€™re actually looking for. An example of user personas can be found here - [User Personas PDF](../docs/UserPersonas.pdf "User Personas").
