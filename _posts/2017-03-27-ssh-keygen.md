For advanced users working from the command line, setting up SSH keys and adding them to the server for public/private key authentication is a common step in configuring their development environment. 

This user guide walks a user through generating an SSH key and then adding that to a their remote server.

This is an example of the more advanced, system admin type of documentation I can provide.
