title: Configuring FTP with FileZilla
---
For many users FTP is still the easiest and most efficient way to manage their websites. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/ "FileZilla"), a free and open source cross-platform FTP/SFTP client, is a great choice for someone who simply needs to move files from their local computer to their web hosting location. 

This user guide walks someone through adding their login information to FileZilla, and then connecting to their web hosting directories to upload files. This is an example of the type of basic, customer-friendly documentation that I can provide.
