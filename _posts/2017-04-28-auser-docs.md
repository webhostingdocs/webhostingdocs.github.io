I can create anything from a simple and user-friendly setup or install guide for a basic product or service all the way up to highly technical developer-centric documentation for APIs and other web services. 

I can also update any existing documentation, making sure it matches your current service offerings and available application versions, matching your existing style and content.   

The documentation I create is clear, concise, and consistent, and focuses on explaining the task, not the technology. I can tailor the documentation I create for any level of user, from a brand new user totally unfamiliar with web hosting all the way up to the most experienced developers and system administrators.
