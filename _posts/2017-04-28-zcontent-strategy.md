As a technical writer one of my main goals is to make sure that the documentation I create matches your business and marketing objectives. This helps to make sure that the messages you are sending your customers, and the messages that your customers are actually receiving, are aligned.   

For example, if you are marketing your services as user friendly but your documentation is written at a very high level or is nonexistent, your content strategy is misaligned. Conversely, if you are trying to market to a high level DevOps user and your documentation spends five paragraphs explaining the basics of SSH, you again have a misalignment in your content strategy.   

I can work with you to understand your business and marketing strategy, and then create new documentation or update your existing documentation to make sure that your content matches your business objectives and goals.
